Nov 2017 – Present Amsterdam, NL | Thrived as a graduate developer in an experienced team working on instant messaging infrastructure which supported high-volume live chat and chat bot applications. As my first taste of development on a large scale, I quickly learned how vital communication and effective collaboration are for complex software to succeed. Moved into a permanent position in the attractions infrastructure team, taking ownership of important projects spanning multiple teams. A key contributor to the core microservices including performance-centric availability and resilient reservation systems as part of our migration to a containerised service-oriented architecture running on Kubernetes. Ensured quality code and regular deployments through automated testing and continuous integration pipelines. Organised and led a hackathon project to create a merge request analysis bot to help foster a constructive code reviewing culture which has now been widely adopted across the company.
